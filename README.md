Overview of each folder:

2023-toroid-off
    Contains the root file prouduced from the toroid-off-analysis-plots directory
    Includes variables such as muon_pt and muon_P that can be used to compare 
    data to simulation

AnalysisFramework
    See README inside of folder

data-pythia-comparison
    Produces plots to compare the 2023 run data to simulation

toroid-off-analysis-plots
    Analysis for run data 
    The original code for toroid-off analysis can be found at 
    https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-endcap-alignment-offline/toroid-off-analysis-plots 
    (ask Nicoletta for access)

tree-conversion
    Modeled off of Camilla's variables for w-jet analysis
    Takes trees produced in ATLAS simulations and prouduces a tree with 
    the same variables but renamed to fit Pythia analysis
