DataAnalysis Package

First log into a node and set up ROOT:
	srun --pty -p largemem --time=0-12:00:00 bash
	source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/LCG_98python3/ROOT/v6.22.00/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/ROOT-env.sh
Then run scripts in this order (commands to run are indented)


MyPythiaSimul.cc
----------------
Generates events using Pythia simulator
and implements the detector effects to output.
a file with truth-level and reco-level data.
Output: data.root
Runs with:
	cd run-pythia
	./MyPythia8Simul MyPythia8Simul.cmnd -outroot data
where the last field, "data", sets the name of the output file to "data.root"
Batch files (ex: bbbar) can be run with:
	sbatch bbbar.sbatch
which submits the job. Job parameters are found at the heading of the document.

MyAnalysis.C
------------
Runs the analysis on the ntuple, defines variables and flags, creates histograms.
At the very top you can specify the name of the output file.
At the bottom of the script in the main function, you can decide whether you want 
to analyze all the files in the directory pythia-outputs/, or make a list of the 
specific files in that directory that you want to analyze.
Input: data.root
Output: analysis.root
Runs with:
	cd analyze-pythia
	root -x -l -q MyAnalysis.C

Plotting files (ex: eventplots.cc)
--------------------
Plots observables, saves plots as png's in analyze-pythia/plots/ directory.
Runs with:
	root -x -l -q eventplots.cc
